### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
- Added them to the assets file

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- I prioritized making a clean archicture in MVVM, and showing different view states in the app.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
- I spent around 6 hours building the app spread across a few day. I allocated my time to first do development, and finish with testing.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- Trade off was passing cache service into child views. Could made a UI model that would hold the UIImages

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- Could add more robust caching system and not pass directly to child views
- Could have also added more logic into which URL is passed into network service layer
- Could add some tests for decoding the data

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
- Excited to hear back about how I built the project!
